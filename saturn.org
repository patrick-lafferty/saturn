This chronicals my new research OS, Saturn, named after the Saturn V.

"We choose to do [this], not because [it] is easy, but because [it] is hard; because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills..."

My initial goal is to boot into a self hosting environment, where I can
work on the kernel in a live environment.

* Step 1: The Cross Compiler
compiling with clang:

clang -c filename.c -o filename.o --target=i686-pc-none-elf -march=i686
    -ffreestanding -fno-exceptions -fno-rtti -Wall -Wextra

boot asm:

i686-elf-as boot.as -o boot.o

linking the kernel:

clang -T src/linker.ld -o saturn.bin -ffreestanding -nostdlib boot.o kernel.o
    --target=i686-pc-none-elf -march=i686
